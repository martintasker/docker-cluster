# Docker Cluster

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a docker cluster of node.js-based services which can easily be brought up quickly, along with a web app which uses them.

Steps to get there:

* understand and explain key points of Docker
* bring up single node app in Docker
* bring up same app in Docker Compose
* introduce a second node app and link it to the first
* bring up a web app in a practical way
* bring in a few other interesting services eg Postgres and Redis

We'll start this on Ubuntu 18.04.  But we'd like this, eventually, to work on Mac and Windows too.
